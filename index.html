            <h2>How to Serve Chinese Fried Rice</h2>
            <p>Fried rice can be served either as a main dish or side dish. Simple fried rice, without any meat or seafood, makes a nice substitute for plain cooked rice at an evening meal. <br>
            At Chinese banquets, fried rice is frequently served at the conclusion of the main meal, before the dessert course.</p>
